# Champions League Data Analysis & Visualization

## Overview
This project analyzes UEFA Champions League match data to provide insights into team performance, goal trends, and match outcomes. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project visualizes match statistics to reveal patterns such as home vs away performance, most common scorelines, top scoring teams, and seasonal trends.

## Features
- Clean and preprocess match data (handle NaN scores, extract home/away goals)
- Visualize total goals per match, goal differences, and score distributions
- Compare home vs away goals and analyze home advantage
- Count match results: Home Wins, Away Wins, Draws
- Identify top scoring teams and teams with best defensive records
- Trend analysis across seasons (average goals, draw percentage)
- Advanced visualizations including heatmaps for home vs away team performance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)

## Insights
- Distribution of total goals and most common scorelines
- Home teams generally score more than away teams
- Top teams by goals scored and goals conceded
- Seasonal trends in goals and draws
- Heatmap analysis of team performance against opponents
